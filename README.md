# The robo-arm project 
### Based on Psoc 4 microcontroller and splitted into two parts - first is based on steppers in use and the other one is with the dc-motors. 


## Work so far

Each motor can be controlled via UART, which direction to choose and what exactly should be done 
There is the link to the presentation containing the videos of algorithms and an example how the uart works.

As well as uart work there're also two algorithms present which can be set up to go by the press of the button on the microcontroller. Currently the easy one defaul algorithms is set to go as soon as the button will be pressed. 

## Usage

* As was already said - there is a serial communication therefore you need any serial terminal we're using Tera Term. 
* Psoc creator as well to run the project 
* All of the connections are shown on the photos on the Readme in the second part
